    Then-Crown Prince Vajiralongkorn sent a letter asking for Princess
    Srirasmi's family to be stripped of their royal name after her seven
    fimily members were arrested. Princess Srirasmi, his third wife, was
    expected to become Queen when Crown Prince Vajiralongkorn succeeds HM King
    Bhumibol, who had been hospitalized.
