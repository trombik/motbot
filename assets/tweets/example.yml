    Hello, world! This is an example tweet. Multiple lines are concatenated in
    a single line, i.e. you cannot use line feed in a tweet. You should break
    a line at 80 characters.

  # if possibly_sensitive is true, those who disabled `Display media that may
  # contain sensitive content` in settings will not see media in the tweet.
  possibly_sensitive: false

  # A list of relative path to images. Images must be under `assets/media`.
  # The images will be uploaded, and shown in the tweet. You cannot use URLs
  # here. Maximum number of images is four.
  media_files: []

# Meta data of the tweet
meta:
  # Time stamp of the event. Valid formats include:
  # - ISO 8601 format (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ISO_8601), i.e.
  #   YYYY-MM-DDThh:mm:ss (without timezone), and YYYY-MM-DDThh:mm:ss+07:00
  #   (with timezone, UTC+7).

  # Note: this does not affect posted tweets.

  # A list of URLs of sources. The URL should be a page where users will find
  # more details. Usually, a single source is recommended because Twitter will
  # show _a card_, an descriptive image of the page under the tweet when a
  # card is available (not all sites have cards, though).
  sources:
    - https://example.org

  # A list of authors of the tweet. When an item is Twitter account name,
  # always quote it because `@` is one of special characters in YAML.
